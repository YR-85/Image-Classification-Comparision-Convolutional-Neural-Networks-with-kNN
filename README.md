# Image Classification: Comparision of (Convolutional) Neural Networks with kNN
After **proofing the universal consistency of the machine learning method kNN** in my **master's thesis**, I wanted to show that this insight is interesting in theory but unfortunately doesn't affect the practical use of kNN. (Convolutional) neural networks outperform this method quite quickly in classifying the classic *MNIST fashion* dataset.
