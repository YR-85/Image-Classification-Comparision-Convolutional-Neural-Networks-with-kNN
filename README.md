# Image Classification: Comparision of (Convolutional) Neural Networks with kNN
After **proofing the universal consistency of the machine learning method kNN** in my **master's thesis**, I wanted to show that this insight is interesting in theory but unfortunately doesn't really affect the practical use of kNN (you would need to gather an infinite amount of training data). (Convolutional) neural networks outperform this method quite quickly in classifying the classic *MNIST fashion* dataset.

Final results can be seen in **results**.
