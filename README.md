# Image Classification: Comparision of (Convolutional) Neural Networks with kNN
After **proofing the universal consistency of the machine learning method kNN** in my **master's thesis**, I wanted to show that this insight is interesting in theory but unfortunately doesn't really affect the practical use of kNN (There is this *small* disadvantage that an infinite amount of training data would have to be available). 
(Convolutional) neural networks outperform this method quite quickly in classifying the classic *MNIST fashion* dataset.

Final results can be seen in **results**.
